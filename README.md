Change it however ya'll want, do whatever ya'll want, it's useful for me. It would be more useful if it could autopasteÂ after putting into the clipboard so I didn't need to use a multi action to paste right after, but that's just QoL I dun wanna do and hope someone else will in the future.

autopaste would make it very similar to "System/Text" but distinctly different as it simply simulates a paste and doesn't try to type out all the input (which is a nightmare trying to send a python function into an IDE with System/Text )
